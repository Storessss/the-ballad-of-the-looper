jackie/Oh... Hello
I'm Jackie, the intelligent spitter
I once consumed this artifact that gave me near Shadekin level intelligence
My family stayed the same though
It's been really hard since then...
//

jackie2//
jackie/Oh... Hello again
We've been going pretty deep, huh?
...
Do you seek it too?
The artifact that can change the past?

zaine/Yes

jackie/...
If we both reach the bottom...
...I hope the artifact has multiple uses, you know?
So that we can both have the future we wish for
...
I wouldn't want to confront anyone to get it...

zaine/Me neither
But I'm willing to fight for it if I have to

jackie/Oh...
...Ok...

zaine/!
I mean...!
I wouldn't fight you, y'know...!

jackie/Ah...
Thank you
...
What's you name?

zaine/Zaine
And you?

jackie/Jackie
...
By the way...
Thank you for talking to me...
This whole thing has been pretty lonely

zaine/Of course!
Any time!
...
Now it's time to continue the descent
We'll talk again later, ok?

jackie/Ok!
See you!
//

abbie1//
abbie/Hello Looper!
Welcome to the shop

zaine/What do you sell?

abbie/A bunch of stuff
Weapons, healing supplies and some magic enhancements
...
I have to ask you though...
You are a Looper, right?

zaine/I'm not really sure of the definition of "Looper"

abbie/Let me rephrase
Are you looking for the artifact that is told to lie at the bottom of this place?

zaine/I am

abbie/...
Not to pry in your business...
But I would suggest to stop looking for the artifact.
I think you should leave this place...
...Leave it all behind...
And never come back.

zaine/What?
Why would I do that.

abbie/You see...
All the people that came into my shop looking for the artifact...
...They eventually come back insane.

zaine/...

abbie/I don't know what happens to them...
But when I see them again they are aggressive,
They act erratically,
They don't even talk to me...
...They just mumble a strange chant and attack me...
...
Every day I am forced to fight innocent people.
People I talked to...
...
Good people.
...
I think...
...That whatever that artifact is...
It's evil.

zaine/...
Ah! I see...
How much money do you make shopkeep?

abbie/Uh... what

zaine/It must be a bustling business...
...It would be really bad if someone snatched the artifact and this dungeon became devoid of people...
...Wouldn't it?

abbie/What...
...What do you mean?

zaine/I know what you're trying to do!
Trust me I've met shopkeepers before...
All you care for is money.
You won't stop me from getting the artifact.

abbie/I'm not-
-I just-

zaine/The artifact is what will fix my life.
It's what will fix everything.
It's what keeps me alive.
It is what gives all the people here hope for a better future.
You should be ashamed.

abbie/I...

zaine/I think this conversation lasted long enough.
Farewell.

jackie3//
jackie/Hey Zaine!
I've met a really wonderful shopkeeper
She was really kind to me
More than most people have ever been
She seemed a bit shaken by something though...
...
That is 2 out of 2 good people...
...Maybe this Dungeon is not as scary as I thought

zaine/A blue fairy shopkeeper?

jackie/Yes!
You've met her too?

zaine/Did she say something about the artifact being evil?

jackie/No?... Why?...
...Is it?
...No wait don't tell me it actually is...!
Please...

zaine/No.
Of course it isn't.

jackie/Oh thank goodness!
Why would she say that though?
It thought she was nice...

zaine/I must have made that up
Sorry I didn't get much sleep

jackie/Oh okay...
Oh! You know what else she told me?

zaine/What?

jackie/She once met some archaeologists and they told her this place is reaaaally old
Like it's been here for all of the planet's existence apparently
...Do you know what that means?

zaine/Not really...

jackie/If in all that time no one "consumed" the artifact...
...It means that it can be used multiple times!
And that people have definitely done that before
This means we can both get the future we want!

zaine/...

jackie/What's wrong...?
This is good news!
Aren't you happy?

zaine/Yes...
...Of course I am...
Thank you Jackie
I'll go now
We'll meet again later

jackie/Okay!
See you!
//

abbie2//
abbie/...

zaine/...I...
Would like to apologize
To you

abbie/Um...

zaine/Is it real?
The Dungeon has been here since the start?

abbie/...
Yes...
Did Jackie tell you...?

zaine/She did.
I...
...Have come to the realization that my outrage was...
...Unjustified...
If the Artifact has really been here for that long...
It either means that it has multiple uses...
...And that you weren't trying to stop me for your own gain...
...
...Or that there is something wrong here.

abbie/Apology accepted 
I'm glad you've come to your senses
...
So will you leave this place?

zaine/I...
Don't think I will...

abbie/What??
But you just said-

zaine/You see:
For us "Loopers" there is no life up there
We come here because it's our last light
Without it we have nothing
No life and no hope

abbie/...

zaine/I think that even if there is something wrong here
We have to try
Just the thought of having another chance if worth any punishment

abbie/...
I Understand...
...But please think about it again

zaine/I already have.
I think we all have.

abbie/I will tell Jackie though...

zaine/Don't.
Nothing good will come of that
Trust me

abbie/...
What is you name?

zaine/Zaine.

abbie/I'm Abbie
You better be right about this.
I don't want to fight any of you

zaine/You won't have to...
...Today is the day we are reborn again...
...Today is the day we change the past.
...
Will I see you again later in the Dungeon?

abbie/Maybe

zaine/Then we'll meet again later
And sorry again
//

jackie4//
jackie/Hey again Zaine
We are slowly reaching the center of Cirau, aren't we?
...
We are close...
...I can feel it.
...
And the enemies...
...They are getting pretty though
Thankfully other Spitters don't attack me...
...I wouldn't feel right killing them...
...
Do you...?
...
Never mind.
...
Say...
You seem pretty strong
I bet we could make a good fighting team
...
How about we fight the next boss together...?

zaine/Sure

jackie/Awesome, I'll meet you in 2 rooms then
Try not to get killed before that
No...
...But actually...
Be careful.
//

jackie5//
jackie/Haha!
We did great!
That boss didn't even stand a chance!
...
Good fighting Zaine
You definitely carried the team
...
I hope I helped you

zaine/You did

jackie/Thanks!
I knew I was getting better with these daggers
I guess this place is good training
...
See you later!
//

abbie3//
abbie/Ah, we meet again Zaine

zaine/Hey Abbie

abbie/You know...
I thought about what you said last time...
...And I had a thought
It may be a little silly...
...But...
...
You wanna hear it?

zaine/What's on your mind?

abbie/I've been in this Dungeon for a long time
And during this time a met a ton of people
One of them was this weird old guy...
...He was really interested in studying Gods and anything relating to them
When I met him he said something along the lines of:
"I inspected this place very carefully...
...And y'know young fairy...
...The signs of a weak but stubborn prophecy resides in these walls...
...It's dim but it's something along the lines of:
"One will come...
...One fueled by misfortune...
...Whose hopeless hope is so strong...
...That it will make this prophecy real...
...And he shall be the one...
That frees all of the Loopers."
It's odd...
This prophecy should't be that powerful...
...Yet it is...
I think there is some devilish trick afoot...
Yet the misfortune of one will be the freedom of many..."
...
I don't really know what he meant...
...But sillily enough...
...I think maybe your future will be different...?

zaine/Of course it will be
As what is a search without the hope of finding?

abbie/...

zaine/How long ago have you heard that?

abbie/I think it's been about...
...3...
...Years...?
...

zaine/Maybe I'm the one that should leave
This place sounds depressing long term
What even keeps you here?

abbie/Oh, y'know...
...
I don't want to be like other fairies!
Oppressed by STUPID Shadekin without reacting because it goes against their beliefs...!
No offense!

zaine/None taken
We can be pretty...
...Cruel

abbie/I'm here to make MONEY
And once I become a billionaire I'll teach those tyrannical Shadekin
By...
...Being more tyrannical back...?
...
I'll work on that...
...
But yeah...
I should probably get out of this place...
I think I missed my younger sister's 16, 17 and 18 birthday...

zaine/...
I think there is one more shop before reaching the bottom...
...Maybe we can hang out with Jackie and talk one last time then...?

abbie/Sure!

zaine/Awesome, see you in a bit then
//

jackie6//
jackie/Oh, hey Zaine...
I've been feeling a bit anxious...
...I mean...
I'm excited!
...But...
...
What will happen after I consume the artifact...?
I don't know how it feels to forget everything...
...To go back to being...
...An animal

zaine/...
Think it about it like this...
...If we die...
...There might be nothing on the other side...
...But we won't feel...
...Sad...
...Or mad...
...Or happy...

jackie/I...

zaine/!
It might sound bad...!
But it won't feel bad...
...It won't feel at all

jackie/...

zaine/S... Sorry...
...
Think about it like this...
...Everything will be fine...
...The anxiety will be gone...
...And there will be nothing to worry about

jackie/...Ok...

zaine/...
Say...
I told Abbie that we will meet her and spend some time together...
...Y'know...
...As a...
New life party?

jackie/...Oh, that sounds fun!

zaine/Great, see you at the last shop then

jackie/Ok, Bye!
//

jackie&abbie1//
jackie/You know...
You might be better at fighting...
...But I'm faster!
I'm always ahead of you!

zaine/You are pretty fast
Hey Abbie

abbie/Hey Zaine
So...
Did you want to talk about anything in specific?

zaine/I did
So...
The next room is the artifact's room...
...We probably won't be able to meet each other again after this...
...Or talk again...
...
And even if with you Abbie...
...Our friendship...
...If you consider me a friend that is...
Has started roughly...
...Because of me...
I wanted to say...
...That it was really nice to spend this time with you both
...

jackie/Same for me Zaine
You both made this descent a lot less scary that it would have been

abbie/It's always nice to talk to good people in this place
And of course I consider you a friend Zaine!
And you too Jackie

jackie/Haha...
It almost...
It almost makes me want to not go in the next room...
...You know...?
But...
...We've gotten this far...
...Right Zaine?

zaine/...
.........
..................
R...Right
...
Do you still have anxiety?

jackie/I...
I do

zaine/Than maybe we should go
You'll see...
...Once you've done it you will feel great...
Think about it like this...
When you have to make a presentation in school...
...You only have anxiety while you wait for your turn...
...And it's even worse than the one you have while actually doing it...

abbie/Makes sense
I believe in you both
Don't worry Jackie...
...Everything will be fine

jackie/Y...Yeah!
You're right!
Everything WILL be fine
Thank you both
For everything 
...
Zaine...
...Go ahead...
It's time to get that artifact.
//

jackie7//
jackie/There it is...
...[rainbow freq=1.5, sat=1.5, val=1.5]THE DISENGAGER[/rainbow]...
...I've never actually heard someone call it that before...
...But somehow...
...I know it's its name

zaine/It's...
Majestic.
The future that awaits us...
Will be truly
...Beautiful.
...
Do you want to go first?
I'll check everything goes alright

jackie/...
What about going together?

zaine/Okay...
Are you ready?
Touch it on 3...

tom/Uhhh...
Hello!
I am Tom
The True God of the Loopers
You must be Zaine!
Pleasure to meet you dear friend

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/Oh jeez...
Am I really that late??
No worries!
No worries...!
You can still understand me under it all
So...
Do you know where we are?

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/Uhh yeah...
Forgot about that...
Yeah uhh...
I can't really understand you...
So I'll translate what I think you are saying
Don't worry I am really good at this
So...
Where were we...?

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/Yeah right
"No dear friend Tom I do not know where we are"
Worry not!
As I know!
We are in an ancient god
You see this dungeon...
...It feeds on people's desperation...
...It lures them in with a false promise and then consumes them until their demise
Disgusting.
Anyway...
You know why it does that?

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/"I know Tom because I am very awesome and smart"
You're right!
But I will explain it anyway because I like explaining

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/"Go ahead"
Gods need devotion to be able to alter the world
They use prophecies to do so
Think about it like devotion being money and prophecies being something nice you would like to buy

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/"But Tom, if all gods need is devotion why can't they just get positive devotion?"
Oh, I wonder the same thing dear friend...
Truth is...
Negative devotion nets you more devotion per devotion...
And this...
...PLACE...
Wants to get the easy way out
But worry not!
Your dear friend Tom has a plan to fix...
EVERYTHING.
And you are part of the plan...
...If you want to that is

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/"I do Tom! What do I have to do?"
Um...
So...
I'm sorry I have to ask this...
But to defeat this place I need a very high amount of devotion...
...I need it to make a prophecy.
Could you...
Whenever there is a bit of calm...
Think about your past?
...
You have to do it in the most painful way possible
Your anxiety is already increased by having Looped...
310...657... Times...?
...Wow I am late
...
But anyway...
I need all the extra devotion I can get
So could you...

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

tom/...
"I will do what I must to free the Loopers, as I am the hero of this story"
Of course you are Zaine
I know you will do great
Oh! And before I forget
You have to hold onto that weird stone in that chest
It will direct all your devotion to me
So don't break or lose it please
...
We will meet again in the deepest place of the dungeon where I can't be detected
Loop #
In the last normal room before the disengager go back to the start and jump in the trapdoor
Got that?
Ok now go!
There is no time to waste

abbie4//
abbie/Oh hey Zaine
Did you come back for a final goodbye?

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

abbie/Oh...
Oh...No...
...How...?
I...
I really thought...
...That this time it would be different 

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]

abbie/I imagine that Jackie...
Oh what I fool I have been...
I could have...
...
Are you going to attack me now...?

zaine/Never

abbie/...

zaine/[shake]...Stops.[/shake]

abbie/...
I think you should go now...

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops.[/shake]
//

zaine1//
mind/You colse your eyes.
You think about your friend
All the bad things you did together 
All the damage and inconveniences you cause the regular people
...
You think harder
You let her die.
You could have done something to try and save her...
...Yet you ran away instead
...
You feel the rock in your pocket getting warmer
That's enough for now
//

zaine2//
mind/You close your eyes.
You think about you parent
All the fights you had
They had already lost one child
Yet instead instead of lifting them up...
...You only made everything worse.
You ran away as that life was "too much to handle"
You only think about yourself.
...
You feel the rock in your pocket getting warmer
That's enough for now
//

zaine3//
mind/You close your eyes.
You think about your brother
His death...
...The catalyst.
From that point on...
...Everything in your life has only gotten worse and worse
You felt too sad at the time to go on normally
Yet when you think about him now...
...You can't feel nothing but...
...Anger...?
Even if it's all your fault...
...You still decide to run away from the source of it all
You.
You do nothing but run
When will you face who you truly are?
...
You feel the rock in your pocket getting warmer
That's enough for now
//

zaine4//
mind/You close your eyes.
You think about Jackie
...
You feel the rock in your pocket getting warmer
That's enough for now
...
No.
It's not enough.
Why were you able to apologize to Abbie but not to anyone else in your life?
You knew that was your final day.
You would rather die than confront your past
And you brought her with you.
You think everyone is like yourself 
They aren't.
They can change.
You being able to do ONE good thing before you died...
...Doesn't mean your life had a positive impact on the world
You can spin it on "hope" how much you want
We both know it's not true.
...
You feel the rock in your pocket getting a lot warmer
That's probably enough
//

tom2//
tom/Yes...!
YES!!
Everything is falling into place...
...Finally...
FINALLY.
Great job Zaine!
I knew I could count on you!
...
Oh...
This is where it gets good
This Dungeon is going to feel our wrath now, friend...

zaine/[shake]The Ballad of the Looper never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops[/shake]

tom/Don't worry
Everything will be very good very soon
You know what happens now?
With this incredible devotion...
...I can make the strongest prophecy I have ever made
OH THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD
This false god that never considered me a threat...
...That kept me around just to consume MY devotion...
Is going to pay.

zaine/[shake]never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops never stops[/shake]

tom/Okay...
...Seeing...
...Your state...
We might need to make this quick
Shame...
...I wanted it to go down reaaaaaal slow
Okay...
I'll ask one final thing of you...
With this prophecy you are more powerful than it...
...And even if it might have some tricks...
You will defeat the Dungeon.

zaine/never... Stops...?

tom/Oh... Yeah...
You have to fight it...
Sorry, I thought I told you already...
But...
BUT
You will win
You have to win.
As you are the messiah
You are the hope
You are the one who will free all the Loopers.
And ALL Loopers...
...From ALL across the universe...
...Shall finally know freedom.
Now and forever.
...
Now go!
Show the world who you truly are!!
//

tom3//
tom/YES!!!!!!!
TAKE THAT!!!!!!!!
WHO IS THE FAILURE NOW MOM AND DAD?????
I JUST BANISHED THE STRONGEST GOD IN THIS DIMENSION!!!!!
WE JUST BANISHED THE STRONGEST GOD IN THIS DIMENSION!!!!!!
YOU JUST BANISHED THE STRONGEST GOD IN THIS DIMENSION!!!!!
Oh Zaine...
My hero!
You truly did it
You saved everyone

zaine/Augh...
What...
What... Is going on...
I...
I... Feel awful...

tom/Oh...
You do...?
You should feel fine technically...
I think you being the one that banished the dungeon might have messed something up...

zaine/:(

tom/Hey
Hey hey hey
Zaine
Zaine.
Everything is going to be fine.

zaine/What do you mean by... 
...Banished...?

tom/Oh yeah...
gods can't die
So they just get sent to a sort of underworld

zaine/Wait do you mean it can come back?!

tom/No no no no
It's basically like it's dead
Actually it's probably worse
There is not way it's coming back.

zaine/...
You know...
...Actually that doesn't make me feel a lot better for some reason...

tom/Anyway
Now I'm the boss of this place
Do you know what that means?

zaine/...

tom/...
It means that there are going to be big changes around here
This dungeon is now going to be a place of Freedom and Equality...
...For ALL Loopers.
H E A V E N.
Especially for you Zaine
I'm going to help you get better
And you will get better
And you'll be the messiah for all other Loopers...
...Spreading your strength to everybody

zaine/I...
Actually I think I want to get out of this place...

tom/...
But...

zaine/I need a break...
I need some fresh air...

tom/...
...Ok...
But know this
I am your guardian angel now...
...I will be there for you

zaine/...

tom/...
Oh...
Could I still ask you for a little favor...?

zaine/...
What is it

tom/You know...
...To transform this place...
...I do need devotion
Could you tell any Looper you see to pray to me?
You can tell you are the one that banished the dungeon...
...But please tell them I had a big part in it
Tell them to come here if they have no place to go
Tell them to come here if life has gotten to much for them
Tell them to come here if they just want to be happy
Tell them I am Tom, the True God of the Loopers

zaine/...Ok...

tom/Thank you, Zaine
